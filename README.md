# OCRGreekTextExtraction

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is a widespread technology to recognize text inside images, such as scanned documents and photos. OCR technology is used to convert virtually any kind of image containing written text
(typed, handwritten, or printed) into machine-readable text data.

This project aims to extract greek text from an image of a popular late greek singer Pantelis Pantelidis.
